Students, as well as teachers, spend a majority of their time in classrooms and in school. The classroom should, therefore, be a stress-free environment where students and teachers feel comfortable spending so much time. It is essential to have a well-managed classroom to improve classroom efficiency and create an environment conducive to learning. A well-managed classroom is not limited to discipline, unlike the popular belief that discipline is the only vital management skill a teacher must have. There are various characteristics that describe a well-managed and efficient classroom.

Student Engagement
Classroom management includes various aspects, but one of the most vital is that the students are engaged. A well-managed classroom will keep the students engaged at all times in the learning process. Students are involved in the learning process, which helps foster higher-level thinking skills in students. Teaching creatively can be a major factor in student engagement because a lesson that is not interesting will cause the students to stop listening and become distracted. A more creative teaching method will capture the student's attention and allow them to focus.

Clear Expectations
Expectations such as class objectives are clear in a well-managed classroom. Students know the material they will be tested on, as well as the teacher's expectations for the various assignments they will be graded on. This also allows for efficiency in the classroom because students manage their time accordingly to move from one task to another effectively. A good way to ensure that students are clear on what the class objectives are is to write the daily tasks on the board at the beginning of each lesson, as well as write any exam dates in a place that students can see regularly.

Effective Time Management
To minimize wasted time and improve efficiency, a well-managed classroom has good time-management skills. The students know which areas in the classroom are accessible to them, as well as where items are placed in the classroom. They also know exactly what to expect from each class in order to ensure good time management. Procedures for distractions such as using the bathroom are in place to avoid minimizing the time students can spend on tasks during class time.

Positive Work Environment
A positive work environment is one of the main characteristics of a well-managed classroom. Students are comfortable asking the teacher questions. The classroom environment is also stress-free to ensure a good workflow and positive environment. Decorating the classroom, as well as allowing the students to participate in classroom decorating, can help encourage a positive work environment.

Firm Discipline
Discipline is an important factor in well-managed classrooms and one of the main characteristics. Students have clear and firm guidelines on which behaviors are allowed in the classroom and which are not, which allows students to remain disciplined and encourage an efficient workflow. Simple things such as guidelines on going to the bathroom or raising their hands when speaking are in place to help keep a positive and effective work environment. Students should also be given positive reinforcement and praise for appropriate behavior and good work to help encourage them and others in the classroom.

Nigeria
In Nigeria, education is classified into four system known as a 6-3-3-4 system of education. It implies six years in primary school, three years in junior secondary, three years in senior secondary and four years in the university. However, the number of years to be spent in university is mostly determined by the course of study. Some courses have longer study length than others. Those in primary school are often referred to as pupils. Those in university, as well as those in secondary school, are being referred to as students.[1]

The Nigerian system of education also has other recognized categories like the polytechnics and colleges of education. The Polytechnic gives out National Diploma and Higher National Diploma certifications after a period of two years and/or four years of study respectively.

Higher National Diploma (also known as HND) can be obtained in a different institution from where the National Diploma (also known as ND or OND) was obtained. However, the HND cannot be obtained without the OND certificate.

On the other hand, colleges of education give out NCE (Nigerian Certificate in Education) after a two-year period of study.

South Africa
In South Africa, education is divided into four bands: Foundation Phase (grades 1–3), Intermediate Phase (grades 4–6), Senior Phase (grades 7–9), and the Further Education and Training or FET Phase (grades 10–12). However, because this division is newer than most schools in the country, in practice, learners progress through three different types of school: primary school (grades 1–3), junior school (grades 4–7), and high school (grades 8–12). After the FET phase, learners who pursue further studies typically take three or four years to obtain an undergraduate degree or one or two years to achieve a vocational diploma or certificate. The number of years spent in university varies as different courses of study take different numbers of years. Those in the last year of high school (Grade 12) are referred to as 'Matrics' or are in 'Matric' and take the Grade 12 examinations accredited by the Umalusi Council (the South African board of education) in October and November of their Matric year. Exam papers are set and administered nationally through the National Department of Basic Education for government schools, while many (but not all) private school Matrics sit for exams set by the Independent Education Board (IEB), which operates with semi-autonomy under the requirements of Umalusi. (The assessment and learning requirements of both IEB and National exams are of roughly the same standard. The perceived better performance of learners within the IEB exams is largely attributable to their attending private, better-resourced schools with the much lower teacher: learner ratios and class sizes rather than because of fundamental differences in assessment or learning content). A school year for the majority of schools in South Africa runs from January to December, with holidays dividing the year into terms. Most public or government schools are 4-term schools and most private schools are 3-term school, but the 3-term government or public schools and 4-term private schools are not rare.

Asia
Singapore
Six years of primary school education in Singapore is compulsory.[2]

Primary School (Primary 1 to 6)
Primary 1 to 3 (aged 7–9 respectively, Lower primary) Primary 4 to 6 (aged 10–12 respectively, Upper primary)

Secondary School ( Secondary 1 to 4 or 5)
Sec 1s are 13, and Sec 4s are 16. Express Students take secondary school from Sec 1 to 4 , and Normal Acad and Technical will take secondary school from Sec 1 to 5.

Junior College (Junior College 1 to 2 - Optional) OR Polytechnic (3 years - Optional)
There are also schools which have the integrated program, such as River Valley High School (Singapore), which means they stay in the same school from Secondary 1 to Junior College 2, without having to take the "O" level examinations which most students take at the end of Secondary school.

International Schools are subject to overseas curriculums, such as the British, American, Canadian or Australian Boards.

Bangladesh
Primary education is compulsory in Bangladesh. It is a near crime to not to send children to primary school when they are of age. But it is not a punishable crime (sending children to work instead of school is a crime). Because of the socio-economic state of Bangladesh, child labour is sometimes legal. But the guardian must ensure the primary education. Everyone who is learning in any institute or even online may be called a student in Bangladesh. Sometimes students taking undergraduate education are called undergraduates and students taking post-graduate education may be called post-graduates.

Education System Of Bangladesh:

Educational Level	Grade	Age	
Primary (elementary school)	1 to 5	6 to 10	
Junior Secondary (middle school)	6 to 8	11 to 13	
Secondary (high school)	9 to 10	14 to 15	
Higher Secondary (college / university)	11 to 12	16 to 17	[3]
